# Project 1: Data Wrangling and Cleaning — Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree

This repository contains Project 1 of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The project focuses on gathering, assessing, cleaning, and storing data programmatically in preparation for analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project centers around the **Twitter WeRateDogs™ dataset**, a collection of tweets containing ratings of dogs. The objective is to wrangle the data programmatically and prepare a clean dataset for analysis.

The project steps include:

* **Data Gathering:** Collecting data from multiple sources (e.g., CSV file, API, image prediction file).
* **Data Assessment:** Visual and programmatic assessment of data quality and tidiness.
* **Data Cleaning:** Cleaning data using pandas, documenting steps taken.
* **Storing Data:** Saving the cleaned dataset to a CSV file for further analysis.

## 📂 Files

* `Data_Wrangling_Project_Starter.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the full wrangling process.
* `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` — Provided archive of WeRateDogs™ tweets.
* `image_predictions.tsv` — File containing image prediction data.
* `tweet_json.txt` — Data collected via Twitter API.
* `twitter_archive_master.csv` — Cleaned dataset output.
