# Project 3: Communicate Data Findings — Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree

This repository contains Project 3 of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The project focuses on performing exploratory and explanatory data analysis on a real-world dataset and communicating key insights through polished visualizations and narrative.

## 📌 Project Overview

The dataset used in this project comes from **Ford GoBike**, a bike-sharing service operating in the San Francisco Bay Area. The dataset contains detailed trip data for rides taken during **February 2019**.

The project is divided into two main parts:

* **Part I - Exploration:**
  In this part, we conducted systematic exploration of the dataset using descriptive statistics and various types of visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.

* **Part II - Explanatory Analysis:**
  In this part, we created polished visualizations and narrative to clearly communicate the most important insights to an audience.

## 📂 Files

* `Part_I_exploration_template.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis.
* `Part_II_explanatory_template.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing explanatory visualizations and narrative.
* `201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv` — The dataset used for analysis.

## 🔑 Key Insights

* The vast majority of trips are taken by **Subscribers**, who use the service mainly for commuting during weekday peak hours.
* **Trip durations** are right-skewed, with most trips under **20 minutes**.
* There are clear patterns in bike usage related to **day of the week** and **time of day**, reflecting the role of bike-sharing in daily transportation.
