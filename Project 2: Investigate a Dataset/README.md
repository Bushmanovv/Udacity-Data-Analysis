# Project 2: Investigate a Dataset — Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree

This repository contains Project 2 of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The project focuses on performing data exploration and statistical analysis on a chosen dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

For this project, we selected a dataset to investigate and analyzed it using NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. The objective was to pose questions, explore the dataset, and communicate findings with visualizations.

## 📂 Files

* `Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis.
* `<dataset_file>.csv` — Dataset used for analysis (replace with actual filename).
